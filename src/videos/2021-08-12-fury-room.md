p1t: What is fury room?
p1c: Have you ever been so angry, so upset, that you felt like destroying
  something? Don't worry, it's normal. In fact, it's so common that some people
  have decided to get rich from this anger. This is how fury rooms were created,
  rooms where you can vent your anger
p2t: Purpose of the site
p2c: "This website is to present the company's offer in a visually pleasing way.
  The colors used here are consistent with the colors of the logo, to give the
  effect of coherence. "
c1tl: Carousel
c1cl: The photo scrolling element, called carousel, uses only pure javascript
  and css. I wanted not to use external libraries like jQuery, because it could
  affect page loading speed
c1tr: Multi-column layout
c1cr: In order to be responsive, columns change their stacking direction when a
  certain value of the browser window width is exceeded. This functionality is
  made possible by using flexBox
