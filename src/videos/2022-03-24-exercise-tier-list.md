p1t: "Life`s too short for bad exercises"
p1c: This sentence was origin of this website idea. Its purpouse is to help save time and avoid not efficient exercises, by representing it in a form of tierlist, form best to worst.
p2t: Website architecture
p2c: Main components of the website are controller, model and views. To provide communication between js files I used modules, and exporting classes.

c2cl: Most important module, coordinates all other components. It react on hash change and render content accordingly, calling other modules.
c2tm: Model

c2tl: Views
