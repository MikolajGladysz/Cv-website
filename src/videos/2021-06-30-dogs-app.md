p1t: App purpose
p1c: >-
  This app was created to practice Android technologies, such as navigation,
  saving data, creating layauts programmatically.


  In this showcase I want to talk about some technologies
p2t: Creating layouts
p2c: >-
  The first step to create a layout is to retrieve data from the server, which
  are then used to create an object of class DogBreed. DogBreed class has all
  the necessary information such as life expectancy, behavior ect.


  Next we use this data to populate layout. This is where RxJava comes in handy with it`s observable sequences. Those sequences are called when data is being changed.
c1tl: Glide
c1cl: To allow for a smoother experience I used Glide to load dogs images and
  loading animation.
c1tr: Sharing
c1cr: If you find a particular breed of dog interesting, you can share it via
  MMS or other app.
c2tl: ""
c2cl: ""
p3t: Navigation
p3c: To navigate between fragments i used Jetpack navigation component. It
  allows to pass data when navigating to other fragment. This way user passes
  proper dog id to fragment on the basis of which right data is beind shown.
