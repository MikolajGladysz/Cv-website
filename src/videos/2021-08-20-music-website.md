p1t: "Website purpose "
p1c: This website is a showcase of striming service, it has a tab with blog
  entries, a music player and a store with tutorials.
p2t: Modular design
p2c: the whole layout is divided into independent sections, which can be broken
  down into components, making it easier to implement frameworks such as vue.js
c1tl: Animations
c1cl: For the most noticeable component loading animations, I used the Aos
  library. Other animations you can find on the page are menu animation (mobile
  version) and object resizing animation (RWD) made in pure css
c1tr: Lighthouse
c1cr: In order to achieve almost perfect score in the lighthouse tool ( 100
  performance on desktop, 93 on mobile) I used only svg icons loaded directly in
  the code of the page, any graphics that have an overlay have lower quality
  (unnoticeable to the user), and besides I stuck to the DRY rule (do not repeat
  yourself), which limited unnecessary code
