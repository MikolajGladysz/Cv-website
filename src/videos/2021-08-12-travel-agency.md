p1t: Website purpose
p1c: "This page is a business card of a company that organizes tours. I tried to
  make the colors on this website refer to the holiday travel, diesign itself is
  to encourage customers to use the services. "
p2t: Elements
p2c: I have included well-known and proven elements on this website to make it
  look interesting. This is a lightweight design, perfect for your travel
  agency.
c1tl: Offer cards layout
c1cl: To achieve the effect of responsive offer cards, I used flexbox. At first,
  my intuition told me to use Grid, but in case the elements are of the same
  size, it is unnecessary.
c1tr: RWD
c1cr: When you reduce the size of the window, some elements change their size,
  others disappear completely. To make it possible I used media queries with
  appropriate window size values
